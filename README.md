# LoginSystem

A full fledge login system based on React, Node and SQL. 
A paid bootstrap theme has been used here so I cant upload the assets but the code implementation is clearly exhibited.
The sign up page registers the user with there credentials and the stored credentials are encrypted and cant be accessed directly. (JWD Tokenization is used here)
MySQL Workbench was used to create the DB
The Web app also maintains the session as in you cant open another session if the current session has not been logged out.
All the email, password and name validations have been added along with warnings.
Axios was used to communicate with the backend API endpoints
